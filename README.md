<p><b> *As of this moment, when you're uploading a torrent(s) you'll get this error "request to https://nyaa.si/api/upload failed, reason: certificate has expired", thus preventing you to upload. I am currently finding someone capable of fixing this error...dunno how long that'll take </b></p>

	<span style="font-size: 14px;">This software was <em>NOT</em> made by me but by a guy in sadpanda in 2017 named <em>health901</em>, whom I have not heard back from him, so majority of the credits goes to him.</span>

	<strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">&nbsp;How to use</span></strong>
</h2>

<p>
	<a href="https://ibb.co/c3sd3RX"><img alt="nyaa" border="0" src="https://i.ibb.co/dMHyMXJ/nyaa.png" /></a>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size: 14px;">Two ways, npm/node or manually. It&#39;s been so long to figure out how to get it working but I&#39;ll try to the best of my abilities.</span>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Npm/node</span></strong>
</p>

<hr />
<p>
	First, add both npm and node.exe in the same directory as where the nyaa mass upload folder is at (although I included them both in), or just download and install Git Bash.
</p>

<p>
	Extract <code>node_modules.rar</code>
</p>

<p>
	Run <code>npm run start</code> or
</p>

<p>
	Run&nbsp;<code>node index.js --open</code>
</p>

<p>
	If it doesn&#39;t open up what you see in the image above, go to whatever browser you&#39;re using and open in the url localhost:5151, then input your credientials for nyaa or sukebei (if you&#39;re uploading to sfw nyaa, uncheck the sukebei box)<br />
	&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Manually</span></strong>
</p>

<hr />
<p>
	Open the folder&#39;s directory.
</p>

<p>
	Open the <code>start.bat</code> file. It will install dependencies, or if already there (?) will quickly close the box.
</p>

<p>
	Open the <code>drag here.bat</code> file. This should pop up the localhost:5151 site in your browser. If not, manually open it yourself.
</p>

<h2>
	<strong><span style="font-size:20px;">Things to Know</span></strong>
</h2>

<p>
	* If you&#39;re uploading, there&#39;ll be a blue and red balloon pop up. The red is usually an error, either stating that there&#39;s already a torrent with the same hash uploaded or an actual error of something else. The blue means your torrent is successfully uploaded.
</p>

<p>
	* You can upload as many as 1000 at a time, but they&#39;ll all be in the same category as where you put the files to! Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to have some batch files in one category and some in another at a time, and I dunno a thing about coding, so...
</p>

<p>
	* Should be able to take torrents written in Japanese/Korean/Chinese.
</p>

<p>
	* <strong>Is it possible for a NyaaPantsu mass uploader? </strong>Well, both NyaaPantsu and Nyaa.si are basically the same, with the exception that NyaaPantsu included what language(s) the torrent contains, tags to AniDB, DLSite, etc., and upload to Nyaa.si/AniDex/Tokyotosho, but I think it can be done. Not possibly by me (because I&#39;m not a coder) but if there&#39;s someone out there capable of giving it a try, or even take this software and modify it to work for NyaaPantsu, please do so!
